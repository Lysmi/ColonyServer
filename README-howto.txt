Setting up 1.18.2 server.

1. Minecraft 1.18.2 server requires JAVA 17. If you don't have it you can download it here: 
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17
Instal it in default location: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.*\bin\java.exe"

2. Open eula.txt file, read EULA and change "false" to "true" if you accept it.

3. Configure server.properties if you need. 

4. Set custom JAVA arguments if needed in user_jvm_args.txt

5. Run run.bat or .sh

If you have an error in console about "Error occurred during initialization of VM" try setting full path in run.bat
Open it with file editor. Change java (in the beginning) to "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.*\bin\java.exe" (where your java is installed)

6. Enjoy
